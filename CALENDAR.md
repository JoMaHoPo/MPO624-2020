# Calendar of class actions and assignments 
### MPO/ATM 642, spring 2020

week | Tuesdays (theory) | Thursdays (computers) | dates
-----|----------|-----------|------
1 | no meeting: reading assignment for next week | no meeting | AMS week 
2 | Assignment: Create a [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/start/) account and install their Chrome plugin. Now, create some annotations on these **3 readings: 1.** [**What is science?**](https://www.nap.edu/read/13163/chapter/4) Opine on what it says. **2.** [**p-values explained simply**](https://towardsdatascience.com/p-value-explained-simply-for-data-scientists-4c0cd7044f14). Did you know this? Have any questions? Any debates? **3. An open-source research paper of your choosing.** Focus your attention and comments on the *experience of the key quantitative evidence (table, graph, image), **not** on the content of the scientific claims.* Specifically, what is the clinching observation *that the reader makes on the page?* A number is different from zero? A number is big, or great, or small, or greatly negative? | The art of working toward the middle. `Jupyter lab` drag and drop demo. For backwards part, examine student annotations from **3.** above, then plot galleries of [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html), [holoviews/geoviews](https://holoviews.org/gallery/index.html), [altiar](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html), [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/plot-gallery.html), Igor, others? | Jan. 21-23
3 | Assignment: 3 more directed readings on science and evidence. **Make annotations as you read. Then, in my discussion questions at the end, write some response with links to your specific annotations as needed. We will look at these in class as a discussion.** [1. Intro chapter to System Identification](https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/bmapes/http/pagestuff/system-identification-intro_sw.pdf), [2. Excerpt on the history of statistics from The Book of Why](https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/bmapes/http/pagestuff/BookOfWhy_excerpt_sw.pdf), and [3. The method of multiple working hypotheses](https://www.whoi.edu/cms/files/chamberlin65sci_72744.pdf). Lecture/handouts: begin on Notations and Nomenclature, gathering key concept+term pairs for exam and applications. | Assignment (just clearing our online communication pipes): Combine parts from 2 Jupyter notebooks (copy and paste in `jupyter notebook`, or drag-n-drop in `Jupyter lab`. Make it work (`import` packages). Upload to your fork so we can look at these in class.  | Jan 28-30
4 | TA lecture (Mapes in Barbados) | Exercise |  Feb. 4-6
5 | The Game of estimation and categorization: key concepts | scikit-learn exercise in prep for next week. Matlabbers, can you demo [this?](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/71819-face-age-and-emotion-detection) | Feb 11-13
