-----|----------|-----------|------
1 | Assignment: Create a [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/start/) account and install their Chrome plugin. Now, create some annotations on these **3 readings: 1.** [**What is science?**](https://www.nap.edu/read/13163/chapter/4) *Close the paywall overlay if it pops up, the text is free behind it.* Read the whole article and opine on what it says. See anything surprising or interesting or debatable? **2.** [**p-values explained simply**](https://towardsdatascience.com/p-value-explained-simply-for-data-scientists-4c0cd7044f14). Did you know this? Have any questions? Any debates? Do you see my one little annotation there? **3. An open-source research paper of your choosing.** Focus your attention and comments on the *experience of the key quantitative evidence (table, graph, image), **not** on the content of the scientific claims.* Specifically, what is the clinching observation *that the reader makes on the page?* A number is different from zero? A number is big, or great, or small, or greatly negative? A curve or pattern is seen to be clearly similar to another one, or clearly different from it? Is a statistical test used (like a p-value)? Share your level of understanding of the evidence (whether clear or confused), and share your course goals to learn to create or better understand such evidentiary artifacts. | Computer & github & Jupyter setup and orientation   |
