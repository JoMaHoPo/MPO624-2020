# Calendar of class actions and assignments 
### MPO/ATM 642, spring 2020

week | Tuesdays (theory) | Thursdays (computers) | dates
-----|----------|-----------|------
1 | no meeting: reading assignment for next week | no meeting | AMS week 
2 | Assignment: Create a [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/start/) account and install their Chrome plugin. Now, create some annotations on these **3 readings: 1.** [**What is science?**](https://www.nap.edu/read/13163/chapter/4) *Close the paywall overlay if it pops up, the text is free behind it.* Read the whole article and opine on what it says. See anything surprising or interesting or debatable? **2.** [**p-values explained simply**](https://towardsdatascience.com/p-value-explained-simply-for-data-scientists-4c0cd7044f14). Did you know this? Have any questions? Any debates? Do you see my one little annotation there? **3. An open-source research paper of your choosing.** Focus your attention and comments on the *experience of the key quantitative evidence (table, graph, image), **not** on the content of the scientific claims.* Specifically, what is the clinching observation *that the reader makes on the page?* A number is different from zero? A number is big, or great, or small, or greatly negative? A curve or pattern is seen to be clearly similar to another one, or clearly different from it? Is a statistical test used (like a p-value)? Share your level of understanding of the evidence (whether clear or confused), and share your course goals to learn to create or better understand such evidentiary artifacts.  | The art of working backwards from your goals: discuss galleries of [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html), [holoviews/geoviews](https://holoviews.org/gallery/index.html), [altiar](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html), others? | Jan. 21-23
3 | Assignment: Use hypothesis to comment on **three more readings on science and evidence.** [1. Intro chapter to System Identification](https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/bmapes/http/pagestuff/system-identification-intro_sw.pdf), [2. Excerpt on the history of statistics from The Book of Why](https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/bmapes/http/pagestuff/BookOfWhy_excerpt_sw.pdf), and [3. The method of multiple working hypotheses](https://www.whoi.edu/cms/files/chamberlin65sci_72744.pdf). Lecture: Notations and nomenclature. Begin gathering key concept-terms for eventual vocabulary-oriented exam. | Assignment (clearing our communication pipes): Operate and adjust a Jupyter notebook, upload to your fork. Discussion: the art of working backwards from your goals, based on galleries of [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html), [holoviews/geoviews](https://holoviews.org/gallery/index.html), [altiar](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html), any others?  | Jan 28-30
