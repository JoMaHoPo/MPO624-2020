## 1. INSTALL Jupyter+Python on your PC or Mac:
#### Follow installation instructions https://unidata.github.io/python-training/

## 2. CREATE their python-workshop conda environment, which installs a set of **packages**. 

## 3. To test your install, execute a notebook from the Unidata workshop

You can browse _static_ versions of all the Unidata notebooks on https://github.com/Unidata/python-training/tree/master/pages/workshop. 

Web-search "jupyter gallery" to find more notebooks, or see the ancillary links in the Unidata workshop materials. If you find a .ipynb you like somewhere in Github, right-click the `Raw` button to download it. Consider installing the Chrome plugin for nbviewer which renders .ipynb files on github.com more reliably. 

Are you new to Python, but know some programming concepts? Consider my ultra-summarized list of first things about python syntax at https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/blob/master/PYTHON_SYNTAX_101.md.
