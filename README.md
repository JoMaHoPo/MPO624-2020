# MPO 624 CLASS FOR SPRING 2020

## Welcome!
The course is all here, no Blackboard will be used. Once you have a Github account (below), `Fork` this repository and `Clone` it to your machine. Then you can `Pull from origin` to get my updates, and `Push` your `Commits` where they can be seen on github.com. 

### Software accounts and installs: 

## The Jupyter-Python (JuPy)-Github software stack
  1. https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/blob/master/GITHUB_QUICKSTART.md
  1. https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/blob/master/INSTALL_JUPYTER_UNIDATA.md
  
## Hypothes.is for our communications over literature and other Web content
  * Click [here](http://hypothes.is) to begin. Learn what it is, and create an account. Install their Chrome browser plugin. To test it, make a visible comment on some Web page. If you wish, learn about how to make private rather than public comment channels (Groups), and invite the instructor to join your class-related Group. 

## Optional other installs 
   
   * Matlab is free to you while you are at UM, because UM pays a handsome fee for an unlimited license. You will need to create an account, verify a UM license token, etc.  It is very powerful, and very well documented, with lots of user-friendly features and customer service (people paid to do tech support). You can install it by starting [here](http://it.miami.edu/a-z-listing/matlab/index.html).
   
   * The IDV (for data integration and visualization), install the [nightly build from Undiata](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/idv/nightly/index.jsp). You will need to create a light sign-in, just so they know whoâ€™s using it.
