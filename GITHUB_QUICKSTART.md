# Create an account on Github, and `Clone` the class repository

----------
1. **Install** the desktop client (app) at https://desktop.github.com/. (This won't interfere with the ability to use command-line git.)

2. **Make an account** on github.com (the desktop client will prompt you on launch, or go directly in a browser).
   - Link your desktop client to your GitHub account by typing your username and password into it.

-----------------
### Clone the course repo, to allow updates and collaboration

3. **Fork** the course repo with the button at upper right on its [page](https://github.com/MPO624/MPO624-2020).

4. **Clone your Fork** to your local machine.

   - In the GitHub desktop client's upper left corner, in the **Add** menu choose **Clone**.

   - You will have to select or create a folder for it on your own computer. Choose its name thoughtfully. It will have some hidden files (under .git) to keep track of versions and branches.

* I found it helpful to illustrate these relations in a visual space, with the Upstream Master at upper left, my Fork in the GitHub.com cloud at upper right, local machine ways of working with the files at the bottom, and the Client as the hub that connects them all. See it [here](https://github.com/MPO624/MPO624-2020/blob/master/classnotes/images/2020-01-23_Cloud_and_local_repos_layout.png).

* Repository "branching" concepts (based on git's command-line names for things) are nice and clear at: https://learngitbranching.js.org/
